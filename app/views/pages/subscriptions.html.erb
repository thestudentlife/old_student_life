<p>The Student Life is pleased to announce a subscription program for parents, alumni, and emeriti faculty. Subscribers will be sent newspapers on Friday mornings by first-class mail to ensure quick and safe delivery. We offer a one-semester and full-year options with at least ten issues each in the Fall and the Spring—a total of at least twenty issues per year. Subscriptions cost $35 for either semester and $60 for the entire year.</p>

<p>TSL keeps you informed about on-campus news and events and is a forum for students’ work. In addition, your subscription will help to promote our goal of creating opportunities for student journalism at Pomona College and within the larger Claremont community.</p>

<p>We look forward to providing you with news on interesting current events and opinions from on campus!</p>
