<h2 style="font-size:24px">Changing your password</h2>

<p>If this is the <strong>first time you're logging in</strong>, your password probably looks something like this: <strong>A7jsT63</strong>. If you can remember that, great!</p>

<p>To change your password to something more memorable, click the link labeled <strong>My account</strong> at the very top-right of this page. You'll be able to enter a new password there.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px">Working with articles</h2>

<p>You can find all articles under the <strong>Articles</strong> tab, near the top of the page. Articles are organized underneath <strong>Issues</strong>, so pick the issue you're currently working on.</p>

<p>Once you click on an issue, you'll see all of the articles currently being worked on. You can see the article <strong>name</strong>, <strong>publication status</strong>, <strong>editorial reviews</strong>, and proposed <strong>titles</strong>. You can click on an article's name to view more information and interact with the workflow.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px">InCopy</h2>

<p>Once you publish an article, you can access its <strong>InCopy document</strong>, <strong>image file</strong>, and <strong>other data</strong> (headline, authors, caption, image credit) on the builtin WebDAV server.</p>

<p>If you're on a Mac, open <strong>Finder</strong> and click <strong>Go->Connect to Server...</strong>, or press <strong>Apple</strong>+<strong>K</strong>, then enter <strong>http://tsl.pomona.edu/webdav</strong> as the server address. If it asks you to log in, any username/password will work.</p

<p>If you're on a PC and figure out how to do this, it would be awesome if you would let me know how, thanks!</p>
